 <h4 align="center">Satellite builds privacy first, modular, P2P platforms and tools, primarily built atop Warp.</h4>

<h4>Our "flagship" product is Uplink.</h4>

Uplink is written in pure Rust with a UI in [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs) (which is also written in Rust). It was developed to be a new foundation for the basic implementation of Warp features in a universal application.

The goal should be to build a hyper-customizable application that can run anywhere and support extensions.
